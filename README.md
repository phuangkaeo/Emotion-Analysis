# Context of the project
In addition to this, you need to know more about it.

You will have to propose several models of classification of emotions and propose a qualitative and quantitative analysis of these models according to evaluation criteria. You will have to investigate through standard machine learning libraries and natural language processing how to obtain the results. best possible prediction performance by taking into account the multi-class aspect of the problem and exploring the impact on the prediction of various preprocessing such as stop-word removal, lemmatization and the use of n-grams, and different approach for vectorization.

You will first have to work with the data set from Kaggle to carry out your training and the evaluation of your models.

In order to enrich our predictions we want to increase our data sets. You will therefore have to work secondly with the dataset provided, from data.world in order to:

In addition to this, you need to know more about it.

On the one hand, compare whether the classification results on your first dataset are similar with the second. Comment.
Combine the two given sets to try to improve your prediction results.
Predict the new emotions present in this dataset about the first messages, and observe if the results are relevant.
- In all, you have to create 5 different classifiers and compare them. Among these 5 classifiers, one of them must be a neural network taking as input data which has undergone an embedding.

You will then have to present your results in the form of a Streamlit multi-page dashboard:

The first page of the Dashboard will be dedicated to data analysis and processing. For example, you can present the "raw" data in the form of a table then the pre-processed data in the same table with a button or drop-down menu allowing you to switch from one type of data to another (display only 'a sample of the results, one in a "scrollable" window). On this first dashboard page will be accessible your graphs relating to your first data analysis (histogram, bubble chart, scatterplot, etc.), in particular - the histogram representing the frequency of appearance of words (comment) - the histogram of emotions (comment)

A second page of the Dashboard will be dedicated to the results from the classifications. You are asked to compare the results of at least 5 classifiers that you will present in a table allowing you to visualize your measurements. On this dashboard page can be found, for example, precision recall curves (used to plot the precision and recall for different probability thresholds), a classification report (a visual classification report that displays the precision, the recall , the f1-score, support, or even a confusion matrix or a graph showing the most representative words associated with each emotion.

Host the dashboard on the Héroku data visualization cloud (https://www.heroku.com/)

Your work will need to be “pushed” on Github.
